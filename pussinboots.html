            <h2>Puss in Boots: The Last Wish</h2>
            <p>Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a 2022 American computer-animated adventure comedy film produced by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by Universal Pictures. The sequel to the spin-off film Puss in Boots (2011) and the sixth installment in the Shrek franchise, the film was directed by Joel Crawford, co-directed by Januel Mercado and written by Paul Fisher, Tommy Swerdlow, and Tom Wheeler. Based on the character from Shrek 2 (2004) and inspired by the fairy tale of the same name, the voice cast includes Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek Pinault reprising their respective roles as the titular character and Kitty Softpaws, with new additions to the cast includes Harvey Guillén, Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Samson Kayo, John Mulaney, Wagner Moura, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and Anthony Mendez. The story sees Puss in Boots teaming up with Kitty and Perrito to find the mystical Last Wish for the Wishing Star to restore the first eight of his nine lives while trying to prevent being killed.</p>
            <p>Plans for a sequel to Puss in Boots began in November 2012, but did not come to fruition, languishing in development hell, until it was revived in November 2018, with Illumination founder and CEO Chris Meledandri confirmed to be an executive producer. It was announced that the film would be helmed by Bob Persichetti, the head of story of the first film and one of the three directors of Sony Pictures Animation's Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018), in February 2019.</p>

            <p>Crawford was later announced as the new director in March 2021, along with Mercado. The story draws inspiration from Spaghetti Western films, with The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) being cited as a particular influence. As with DreamWorks' previous film The Bad Guys (2022), the film's style is inspired by Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. With new technology, the team was able to give the film a painterly style to resemble a fairy-tale story, rather than using the realistic visual style of previous installments in the Shrek franchise.</p>
            <p>Puss in Boots: The Last Wish premiered at Lincoln Center in New York City on December 13, 2022, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 21, 2022, after being delayed due to restructuring at DreamWorks. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing $484.7 million worldwide on a production budget of $90–110 million and becoming the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2022. At the 95th Academy Awards it was nominated for Best Animated Feature, as well as receiving nominations at the Golden Globes, Critics' Choice Awards, and British Academy Film Awards.</p>
