            <h2>Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse reviews:</h2>

            <h3>10/10 Rating: Perfect</h3>
            <p>The 5 years was worth the wait. Amazing animation, beautiful characters with rich backstories, the fights are amazing, Gwen's story is amazing, EVERYTHING IS AMAZING! This entire movie is gorgeous and keeps you hooked and almost forces you to continue watching, that's how amazing it is. The hype around this movie was 100% deserved and made sense, seeing as how this movie may be the greatest film I have ever seen.</p>
            <p>This isn't your run of the mill kids move, action movie, animated movie. It's a masterpiece that all ages can enjoy. An amazing sequel that sets extremely high hopes for the third movie.</p>
            <p>Perfection is the best word for this movie.</p>

            <h3>9/10 Rating: Genuinely good</h3>
            <p>Rarely do I give movies 9 stars, and rarely do I think watching a movie is actual "fun". But this was, without any hesitation, great and literal fun. There are some logical flaws which will appear during the viewing, nonetheless the animation is impeccable and how the story goes is also great. Recommendation without hesitation.</p>
            <p>On a side node: This is how you make poc people being represented well. Not randomly switching skin colors, but making great characters of their own. At this point Morales is literally edging on the popularity of Peter Parker. Just make cool characters!</p>
            <p>If you're unsure; Watch it.</p>

            <h3>7/10 Rating: Fine, but definitely doesn't deserve a rating of 8.7/10.</h3>
            <p>I had decently big expectations for this one, especially for a spider man movie, but rarely any of them were filled.</p>
            <p>I don't know how people find this movie that great, i just find it an ok movie with an ok plot. I definitely saw a lot of potential, but the plot was too overwhelming with so many things in the background. Main thing that i didn't like was the lack of action. I went to watch this movie to see a great plot, and a ton of action, but that certainly didn't happen.</p>
            <p>The first 40 minutes of the movie covers just the main characters which i found pretty boring. Rest of the movie was just 20 things happening at the same time. I felt like falling asleep halfway through, but luckilt at least there was some action.</p>
            <p>Definitely an "Avengers: infinity war" try, but lacks action. 7/10 at most.</p>

            <h2>Puss in Boots: The Last Wish reviews:</h2>

            <h3>10/10 Rating: Haven't seen an animated movie like this in years</h3>
            <p>Wow ! Dreamsworks has always been good with sequels and I think it is safe to say this might be their best sequel to date .</p>
            <p>Without giving much of the plot there are many new characters and fairy tales introduced here and they actually help elevate the story alongside with being so cute ,loveable and hilarious .</p>
            <p>Appealing to both kids and adults ,this movie was a treat ,it mixes being a fun continuation to the story without repeating the same tropes of the first movie and also handles heavy topics without feeling grim ,dark or taking itself too seriously.
            <p>Highly recommended and worth every penny ðŸ‘Œ</p>

            <h3>9/10 Rating: unexpectedly GOOD for adults and kids</h3>
            <p>FYI, surprisingly, kids understood jokes aimed at adults. Yes, there are spots of the movies where it's hard to know what they understand because ideas aim at us adults. But, I think the kids still understood it enjoyed the deeper parts.</p>
            <p>Personally, the movie was very fitting. Like Puss, I'm also trying to find out who I am and who I want to be in life. This was our journey.</p>
            <p>The stories have great connections romantically, between rivals and newcomers. The stories are about bringing all of us together despite what happened in the past. The stories come together about building a better future for ALL OF US. Let go of selfish wants and desires, focus on OTHERS and let's work together for a better future!</p>
        
            <h3>5/10 Rating: A bit too dark and scary for a "kids" movie</h3>
            <p>I'm glad I *didn't* take my younger kids to see this. I would not recommend this film for young children. The big bad wolf appearing throughout the film is quite a dark/scary character, combined with the overall themes around death. The other 'bad guy' characters (Jack Horner, Goldilocks and The Three Bears) are quite sinister in parts.</p>
            <p>There are several jump-scare moments, suspenseful scenes and fight scenes with dramatic SFX.</p>
            <p>There is some humour to offset the darkness, but this is definitely not the bright and happy comedy movie you'd expect from the Dreamworks / fairytale / Shrek spin-off franchise.</p>

            <h2>The Super Mario Bros Movie reviews:</h2>

            <h3>8/10 Rating: Nostalgia at it's best</h3>
            <p>This film is no 'original' idea like Despicable me...... it's not meant to be!!! It's simply a Mario film for the fans and sticks with all game themes beautifully (again, as it should be).</p>
            <p>Voices are perfectly cast....esp bowser (Jack Black).</p>
            <p>The plot was simple and totally expected. As it should have been! The game features transferred to the movie perfectly. Adult puns and jokes in there as well as ones the kids will get.</p>
            <p>Our seven year old son thought it was amazing and he only knows Mario Kart in the gaming world. So it's appealing all round for adults (nostalgia) for kids (pure fun).</p>

            <h3>6/10 Rating: Not terrible, just instantly forgettable.</h3>
            <p>As an avid gamer, but not really big in the Nintendo sphere, I was looking forward to this, but wanting it to be a good story, good direction and funny for adults and kids rather than seeing all the Easter eggs and nods to the Mario players. Unfortunately it delivers mostly on animation quality and amount of fan service, while the story, jokes and general writing are average at best, but mostly predictable and actually quite boring.</p>
            <p>My 5yo loved it, but even he could barely recall any of the movie by the next day, whereas the classics (pixar, disney, other illumination selections) he can recall and quote them for days after!</p>
            <p>In summary - Great for a quick watch for the kids, a bit meh for the adults, won't stick in your mind.</p>

            <h3>5/10 Rating: I already forget</h3>
            <p>Completely unmemorable. I didn't hate anything in the movie and even kind of enjoyed some of the funnier moments (Jack Black as Boswer steals every scene he's in) but it was so unoriginal and so formulaic it felt like a cliff notes of a plot rather than an actual plot. I'm still in the parking lot of the theater and I'm struggling to remember anything about the movie. Just the epitome of mediocre.</p>
            <p>I think it's also about time we stop hiring famous actors to play animated characters just because they're famous actors. Some of the actors do great in this, but there was absolutely nothing about Pratt's performance that justified him being cast.</p>
